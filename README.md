I created my first basic calculator in Java.

I would like to make a note: the calculator's display is divided horizontally into two screens, one at the top where your expressions are displayed, and another at the bottom showing the result. Click with the mouse on the top of the display when typing on your keyboard, so that your calculation appears correctly on the display.

I hope you like it, thank you!!!
